### Writing tests

Writing a test is just like writing a function, with a few rules

* It needs to be in a file with a name like `xxx_test.go`
* The test function must start with the word `Test`
* The test function takes one argument only `t *testing.T`
* In order to use the `*testing.T` type, you need to `import "testing"`, like we did with `fmt` in the other file

### Go doc

Godoc install it with `go get golang.org/x/tools/cmd/godoc`

You can launch the docs locally by running `godoc -http :8000`. If you go to [localhost:8000/pkg](http://localhost:8000/pkg) you will see all the packages installed on your system.

`go test -v`

### Benchmarking

Writing [benchmarks](https://golang.org/pkg/testing/#hdr-Benchmarks) in Go is another first-class feature of the language and it is very similar to writing tests.

```go
func BenchmarkRepeat(b *testing.B) {
	for i := 0; i < b.N; i++ {
		Repeat("a")
	}
}
```

You'll see the code is very similar to a test.

The `testing.B` gives you access to the cryptically named `b.N`.

When the benchmark code is executed, it runs `b.N` times and measures how long it takes.

The amount of times the code is run shouldn't matter to you, the framework will determine what is a "good" value for that to let you have some decent results.

To run the benchmarks do `go test -bench=.` (or if you're in Windows Powershell `go test -bench="."`)

#### Finding unchecked errors
There is one scenario we have not tested. To find it, run the following in a terminal to install `errcheck`, one of many linters available for Go.

`go get -u github.com/kisielk/errcheck`

Then, inside the directory with your code run `errcheck .`

You should get something like

`wallet_test.go:17:18: wallet.Withdraw(Bitcoin(10))`
